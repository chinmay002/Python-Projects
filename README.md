1> Card_project
The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.
The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher 
card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored
If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war".[2] Both players place the next three cards face down and then another card face-up.The owner of the 
higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the
battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards.This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.



2>Black Jack

Players are each dealt two cards, individually facing  normally one up(exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer only receives one card face up.
The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. 
A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called "soft",
meaning that the hand will be guaranteed to not score more than 21 by taking an additional card.The value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21.

Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either exceeded the total of 21 or 
received blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must draw cards, one by one, until the cards total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer must stop.
Players bet on the basis that they will individuallyhave better hands than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without 
exceeding 21. The detailed outcome of the hand follows:

If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card  and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.
If the player exceeds a sum of 21 ("busts"), the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.
If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust, the player wins.
If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, this will be called a "push" and no one wins.
